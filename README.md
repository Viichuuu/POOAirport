1. Introduction
  This document describes and presents our design of the implementation of an airport simulation
  This simulation manages different airplanes landing in a new airport taking into account the runway management and some variables like fuel or aircraft type

  In this document we explain the design choices, the structure and classes, the challenges we faced and our final conclusions after developing this project
